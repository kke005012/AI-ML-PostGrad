However, lower scores emerged when retrieval introduced off-topic or overly broad information (e.g., diagnostic philosophy instead of treatment steps). This underscores the importance of tight retrieval granularity and query-specific tuning in future iterations."],"metadata":{"id":"yXejggwsze9X"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Y7QICRU-njdj"},"source":["## Actionable Insights and Business Recommendations"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 📈 Actionable Insights and Business Recommendations\n","#### 1. High-Quality Retrieval Is Critical\n","Retrieval quality directly impacted the usefulness and accuracy of generated answers. Even well-tuned models struggled when the context was irrelevant or vague. Future systems should prioritize advanced chunking strategies (e.g., semantic overlap, context window tuning) to improve RAG performance.\n","\n","#### 2. Medical QA Systems Require Guardrails\n","Even with clinical documents like the Merck Manual, responses occasionally included generic or partial answers. A production system should include answer validation layers—such as confidence scoring, citation checks, or expert review triggers—to reduce medical risk.\n","\n","#### 3. Prompt Engineering Drives Clarity\n","Prompts that clearly specified the desired format (symptoms, cause, treatment) yielded better-structured responses. Clinical AI tools should adopt consistent prompt templates tailored to practitioner needs—triage checklists, diagnosis trees, or treatment protocols.\n","\n","#### 4. Redundancy May Signal Strength or Weakness\n","Many outputs were nearly identical across temperature/top-p variations, which could indicate strong model certainty—or weak retrieval variety. Business applications should balance this by tuning for informative diversity without sacrificing consistency.\n","\n","#### 5. Use Human-in-the-Loop for Edge Cases\n","For complex, rare, or high-stakes medical queries (e.g., brain trauma or sepsis management), automated RAG systems should escalate to human review or provide disclaimers. This protects both patient safety and organizational liability.\n","\n","#### 6. Opportunities for Commercialization\n","There is strong business potential in adapting RAG systems to serve as clinical assistants for medical education, patient FAQs, or intake triage support. A fine-tuned system with structured prompts and curated documents can reduce practitioner burden and improve patient access."],"metadata":{"id":"EMGp1O0CxMkE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ybRlzaIhWaM9"},"source":["<font size=6 color='blue'>Power Ahead</font>\n","___"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!jupyter nbconvert --to html /content/drive/MyDrive/Full_Code_NLP_RAG_Project_Kristi_Esta.ipynb"],"metadata":{"id":"-bdF4znX1gRb","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753753565814,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":4225,"user":{"displayName":"Kristi Esta","userId":"03435076932476762330"}},"outputId":"3625d813-0d45-44cc-eb1d-62310064ad79"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[NbConvertApp] Converting notebook /content/drive/MyDrive/Full_Code_NLP_RAG_Project_Kristi_Esta.ipynb to html\n","/usr/local/share/jupyter/nbconvert/templates/base/display_priority.j2:32: UserWarning: Your element with mimetype(s) dict_keys(['application/vnd.colab-display-data+json']) is not able to be represented.\n","  {%- elif type == 'text/vnd.mermaid' -%}\n","[NbConvertApp] Writing 534051 bytes to /content/drive/MyDrive/Full_Code_NLP_RAG_Project_Kristi_Esta.html\n"]}]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"collapsed_sections":["lnwETBOE6Bz5"],"gpuType":"T4","provenance":[]},"kernel_info":{"name":"python310-sdkv2"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"microsoft":{"host":{"AzureML":{"notebookHasBeenCompleted":true}},"ms_spell_check":{"ms_spell_check_language":"en"}},"nteract":{"version":"nteract-front-end@1.0.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
